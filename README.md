## Introduction
This notebook is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to handling data from initial exploration to preprocessing before analysis or modeling. It aims to equip users with the necessary skills to prepare datasets for advanced analytics and machine learning tasks.

## Setup
To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
```

## Data Exploration
Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and key statistics. This includes visualizing distributions, relationships between variables, and identifying missing values.

## Data Wrangling
Techniques to manipulate and transform data to suit the analysis needs. This section demonstrates merging, grouping, reshaping, and more.

## Data Cleaning
Steps to clean the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Final preparation of the data, including encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
